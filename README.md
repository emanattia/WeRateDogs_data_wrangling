# WeRateDogs_data_wrangling

Tweet archive is the dataset that I worked on it. It’s the data of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of ten.
Here’s I answerd three questions:
1. What is the most common dog stage?
2. What is the most common dog names?
3. What is the relation between retweet count and favorite count? What is the most given ratings?
4. What is the most given ratings for the dogs?
